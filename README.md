This project is a terminal report generated by a sonarqube docker. <br>
This project was created because of my laziness of having to access the site every time I want to see the coverage and code smells

Hope you enjoy it =)

#project configuration

featueres to add:
- [X] show metrics of coverage and code smell (percentage)
- [x] use config file to set order and which metric should be used
- [ ] show specific metrics of code smell and security (specifc percentage)
- [ ] show messages after percentage report
- [ ] print with color depending of "warning level"
- [ ] save report in file
This project uses a .conf file to get variables to run.

variables:<br>
* name: project name (just set what you want to show it in the report)
* key: project key (the one you put in sonar docker when creating your project profile)
* metrics: these are the porcentage generated on the sonar, you should put the same of the sonar API documents
* detais: these are some detais of the metrics, in a simple way, it's the number of each kind of code smell and security problens (not implemented yet)
* specific data: these are some messages of  data, I'm trying to use that to get code smell messages.
